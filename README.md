# Classifying-Cancer-Cells-using-Support-Vector-Machine

## About the Project
This is a classification problem. I use SVM(Support Vector Machine) to build and train a model using human cell records to classify cells as either benign or malignant.

## Prerequisites
The following libraries and dependwencies are used in this project:
* Numpy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Scikitlearn
* Metrics
* SVM
* Preprocessing
* train_test_split
* f1_score
* jaccard_score

## The Dataset 
The dataset is obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository (Asuncion and Newman, 2007) and is publicly available [here](/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-ML0101EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/Module%203/data/cell_samples.csv).
The data labels are as follows:
| Field name  | Description                 |
| ----------- | --------------------------- |
| ID          | Clump thickness             |
| Clump       | Clump thickness             |
| UnifSize    | Uniformity of cell size     |
| UnifShape   | Uniformity of cell shape    |
| MargAdh     | Marginal adhesion           |
| SingEpiSize | Single epithelial cell size |
| BareNuc     | Bare nuclei                 |
| BlandChrom  | Bland chromatin             |
| NormNucl    | Normal nucleoli             |
| Mit         | Mitoses                     |
| Class       | Benign or malignant         |
